pcAnywhere patches

Here's the drill.
Close down pcAnywhere.
Have this message open, but reduce the box size so that you can still see the task bar.
 
ONE at a time:
Highlight the first line below.
Press CTRL-C to copy it into the scratch pad.
Go to Start, Run and press CTRL-V to patch it into the Open line.
Click on GO to run it.
You'll get a brief dialog box that says the program is registered.
 
Repeat for the other two.
 
That's it. 
Bring up pcAnywhere and retest the File Transfer function.
